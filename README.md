Modular Automation Platform system for all things &amp; process to be automated.

The main intention of this platform to come into existence is to help everyone of us to strive towards sustainable lifestyle. Since human population is expanding rapidly and the earthly resources are limited basically to what it is, therefore, we can see that there is a need for us to quickly learn, adapt and improvise the way we use these fairly limited resources which will run out in the near future. It could lead us rather fighting over then such scare resources, therefore, it is a responsibility for us humans to remain humans, and continue to share, preserve and make things better for the future. Since it is a vast spectrum of them, lets break down to two major categories, Needs & Wants.

We consider the basic resources such as water, air, food and shelter is a necessity, hence, everything else is considered luxury.

# Basic Resources (Needs)
Needs are those which all living beings, including humans need for survival. Keeping it simple and addressing the modern day issues will help rightly utilise this basics for sustainable present & future.

## Water
 The most abundant, yet so scarce in terms of usable resource. It is also one of the most powerful resource, that could determine the existance or competely wipe out a civilization. This is one resource that everyone respects and also fights vehemently for its possession. Let's conserve this, as it is one of the most important resource that will keep humans sane and rightful or completely turn on each other if not managed well.

- ### [Water Manager](Needs/Water/WaterManager/)
  A system which manages all the water resources, fresh/raw, potable, gray, to black. Nothing is waste if we know how to use it.

- ### [Potable Water Monitor](Needs/Water/PotableWaterMonitor/)
  Potable Water is rapidly becoming a luxury, although it is abundant enough for all life to thrive. So our first module will be to provide solutions for usage, managing, recyling and conservation techniques with technology for all things Water.

- ### [Water Level Controller](Needs/Water/WaterLevelController/)
  Modern homes are equipped with an electric water pump up to storage tanks. However, it is at this very stage we see a major loophole in the wastage when it overflows once the tank is full. A Modular Automated Water Level Controller should help in addressing this issue.
 
  This will be the first ever module that is an absolute necessity, also one of the most affordable, so implemented by almost everyone. Having a smart, connected and yet being affordable is key, so we are designing it here.

## Air
 Air is the most critical part of all the resources, however the effective controlability is largely limited for any individual or a small group. So it is better 

- ### Clean Breathable Air
  Air purifiers do a wonderful job in a contained space, however they are limited and the resources it takes are not anywhere near to sustainable. However, there are many solutions which will work only if other domains will make the necessary changes.

## Food
 Modern agriculture is certainly feeding a plenty of mouths, however it is coming at a cost for both us humans in terms of health and also for the environment which is unsustainable in the long run. Making certain changes, by learning from our ancestors has many ways to make both food safer and environment friendly.
 - ### Right & Best Foods
   Organic, chemical free and native food are the only way this planet & us humans can sustain almost perpetually. Growing, sourcing, consuming and recycling is key.

## Shelter
 Once the tummy is full, a safe shelter becomes the final need for every living being, including humans. However, the modern humans are quickly becoming disconnected from the needs towards the wants that is detrimental to them and the ecology in the near distant future.
 - ### Safety
 - ### Security

# Luxury (Wants)
Once the 'Needs' are fulfilled, then wants awakens.

- ## Energy
  Apart from food, Energy is essential for the modern human on a daily basis. Keeping it sustainable is key for a safer & healthy us.

  - ### Electricity
    Electricity runs almost everything these days, and unfortunately it still is generated from resources that are nowhere near to ecologically stable. However, renewable energy systems are fast replacing the traditional fossil energy based generators.

  - ### Solar Power
    One of the best ways to harness energy, with a trinklet of ecological damage compared to the traditional fossil & other sources.

    - #### Solar MPPT Charge Controller

    - #### Solar MPPT Inverter

- ## Mobility
  Mobility is a great invention by modern humans and is a luxury of many these days. There is a little problem, the emissions, which is also being addressed in the recent decades.

  - ### EV Charging infrastructure.
    EV's are fuelled by electricity from their onboard batteries, and those batteries need to be charged often and should be availabile in plenty.

    - #### EVSE Plugs
      A simple smart plug would suffice for most of these needs, and we will be addressing them on priorities.
